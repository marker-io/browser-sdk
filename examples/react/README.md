# marker-io-sdk-example-react

An example of loading a Marker.io widget and using SDK methods in React

## Project setup

First make sure to install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, start your development server using:

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, navigate to <http://localhost:5173> to open your running React app.

## Getting your project ID

The project ID is an immutable value that allows linking Marker.io to your project widget.

Get it with these simple steps:

1. Navigate to your Marker.io dashboard at <https://app.marker.io>
2. Open a project, then navigate to its installation settings, choose "Snippet code"
3. Copy your project ID from the snippet code itself.
